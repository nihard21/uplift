## Purpose

Uplift is a journaling and reflection app designed to help users process their thoughts, track personal growth, and practice mindful reflection. The app provides a calm, conversational interface where users can write entries, revisit past reflections, and feel encouraged to reflect consistently.

## Features

- 📝 Write and save journal entries  
- 💬 Chat-style interface for guided reflection  
- 📅 View and revisit past entries  
- 🌱 Encourages emotional awareness and self-growth  
- 🎨 Clean, minimal UI focused on ease of use

## Motivation

Uplift was created to combine technology with well-being. Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection, but many people struggle with consistency. This project explores how thoughtful UI design and conversational interfaces can make reflection feel more natural and approachable.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js (via v0.app)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Design & Iteration:** v0.app

## How to Use

1. Open the deployed app  
2. Begin a journal entry through the chat interface
3. Click AI analysis to view summary of your emotions + tips to improve
4. Write daily journal entries to develop weekly and monthly trends and insights
5. Revisit past entries to track progress and growth

## 🛠️ Development Process

During the development of Uplift, our team worked through both design and technical challenges to build a journaling experience that felt intuitive and meaningful.

### Exploration and Design Iteration
We began by defining the core purpose of the app: to support emotional reflection through a conversational journaling interface. Early iterations focused on creating a **minimal, distraction-free UI** that encouraged consistent use without overwhelming users. Several design iterations were needed to balance simplicity with functionality.

### Chat-Style Interaction Logic
A major focus of development was implementing the **chat-style interface** that allows users to write reflections naturally while still being able to revisit past entries. We refined component structure and interaction flow to ensure the experience felt smooth and responsive across sessions.

### Integration and Deployment
Uplift is built using v0.app and deployed through Vercel, which allowed us to rapidly prototype and test changes. Setting up automatic syncing between the visual editor, GitHub repository, and live deployment helped us iterate quickly while maintaining a stable codebase.

### Challenges
One challenge we faced was ensuring the chat interface remained intuitive as features were added. Early versions became cluttered, making reflection feel less natural. Through testing and iteration, we simplified layouts and reduced unnecessary prompts to keep the focus on thoughtful journaling.

### Reflection
Through this process, we learned the importance of iterative design and user-centered development.

## Future Improvements

- Visual insights  
- Search and filtering for past entries  
- Daily reflection reminders  
- User accounts and secure data storage
